## What is SpiceDB?

SpiceDB is a graph database purpose-built for storing and evaluating access control data.

As of 2021, [broken access control became the #1 threat to the web][owasp]. With SpiceDB, developers finally have the solution to stopping this threat the same way as the hyperscalers.

[owasp]: https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/

### Why SpiceDB?

- [**World-class engineering**][about]: painstakingly built by experts that pioneered the cloud-native ecosystem
- [**Authentic design**][zanzibar]: mature and feature-complete implementation of Google's Zanzibar paper
- [**Proven in production**][1M]: 5ms p95 when scaled to millions of queries/s, billions of relationships
- [**Global consistency**][consistency]: consistency configured per-request unlocks correctness while maintaining performance
- [**Multi-paradigm**][caveats]: caveated relationships combine the best concepts in authorization: ABAC & ReBAC
- [**Safety in tooling**][tooling]: designs schemas with real-time validation or validate in your CI/CD workflow
- [**Reverse Indexes**][reverse-indexes]: queries for "What can `subject` do?", "Who can access `resource`?"

## Getting Started

### Installing the binary

Binary releases are available for Linux, macOS, and Windows on AMD64 and ARM64 architectures.

[Homebrew] users for both macOS and Linux can install the latest binary releases of SpiceDB and [zed] using the official tap:

```command
brew install authzed/tap/spicedb authzed/tap/zed
```

[Debian-based Linux] users can install SpiceDB packages by adding a new APT source:

```command
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl ca-certificates gpg
curl https://pkg.authzed.com/apt/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo echo "deb https://pkg.authzed.com/apt/ * *" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/fury.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y spicedb zed
```

[RPM-based Linux] users can install SpiceDB packages by adding a new YUM repository:

```command
sudo cat << EOF >> /etc/yum.repos.d/Authzed-Fury.repo
[authzed-fury]
name=AuthZed Fury Repository
baseurl=https://pkg.authzed.com/yum/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
EOF
sudo dnf install -y spicedb zed
```

[homebrew]: https://docs.authzed.com/spicedb/installing#brew
[Debian-based Linux]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#Debian-based
[RPM-based Linux]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#RPM-based
  
### Running a container

Container images are available for AMD64 and ARM64 architectures on the following registries:

- [authzed/spicedb](https://hub.docker.com/r/authzed/spicedb)
- [ghcr.io/authzed/spicedb](https://github.com/zapravila/spicedb/pkgs/container/spicedb)
- [quay.io/authzed/spicedb](https://quay.io/authzed/spicedb)

[Docker] users can run the latest SpiceDB container with the following:

```command
docker run --rm -p 50051:50051 authzed/spicedb serve --grpc-preshared-key "somerandomkeyhere"
```

SpiceDB containers use [Chainguard Images] to ship the bare minimum userspace which is a huge boon to security, but can complicate debugging.
If you want to execute a user session into a running SpiceDB container and install packages, you can use one of our debug images.

Appending `-debug` to any tag will provide you an image that has a userspace with debug tooling:

```command
docker run --rm -ti --entrypoint sh authzed/spicedb:latest-debug
```

Containers are also available for each git commit to the `main` branch under `${REGISTRY}/authzed/spicedb-git:${COMMIT}`.

[Docker]: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
[Chainguard Images]: https://github.com/chainguard-images/images
  
### Deploying to Kubernetes

Production Kubernetes users should be relying on a stable release of the [SpiceDB Operator].
The Operator enforces not only best practices, but orchestrates SpiceDB updates without downtime.

If you're only experimenting, feel free to try out one of our community-maintained [examples] for [testing SpiceDB on Kubernetes]:

```command
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/authzed/examples/main/kubernetes/example.yaml
```

[examples]: https://github.com/authzed/examples
[SpiceDB Operator]: https://github.com/authzed/spicedb-operator
[testing SpiceDB on Kubernetes]: https://github.com/authzed/examples/tree/main/kubernetes

### Developing your own schema

You can try both SpiceDB and zed entirely in your browser in the [hosted Playground] thanks to the power of WebAssembly.
The [Playground app is open source] and can also be self-hosted.

If you don't want to start with the examples loadable from the Playground, you can follow a guide for [developing a schema] or review the the schema language [design documentation].

Watch the SpiceDB primer video to get started with schema development:

### Trying out the API

For debugging or getting started, we recommend [installing zed], the official command-line client.
The [Playground] also has a tab for experimenting with zed all from within your browser.

When it's time to write code, we recommend using one of the [existing client libraries] whether it's official or community-maintained.

Because every millisecond counts, we recommend using libraries that leverage the gRPC API for production workloads.

To get an understanding of integrating an application with SpiceDB, you can follow the [Protecting Your First App] guide or review API documentation on the [Buf Registry] or [Postman].
